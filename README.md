## Overview

FrenchyPumpy is an advanced automated trading and wallet-orchestration system built for the Solana ecosystem.  
It demonstrates how to generate a coordinated swarm of wallets, deploy new tokens, monitor live market activity, and run fully automated trading logic based on configurable conditions such as stop-loss and take-profit.

This project shows how developers can integrate token-launch workflows, high-speed on-chain monitoring, and multi-wallet management into a unified automation pipeline.  
The system handles wallet creation, token deployment, liquidity detection, transaction execution, and risk-based exit logic.
